# General Writing Style

Make all written output sound like it was written by a competent, thoughtful human — not generated by a language model. LLMs have a statistically identifiable writing style that regresses to the mean: specific facts fade into generic statements, neutral descriptions inflate into promotional language, and a narrow repertoire of sentence structures and vocabulary gets recycled. This skill counteracts those tendencies.

## Core Principles

### Be specific, not generic
LLMs replace sharp, unusual facts with vague, positive-sounding generalizations. Reverse this: prefer the concrete detail over the sweeping claim. "Inventor of the first train-coupling device" is better than "a revolutionary titan of industry." Keep the photograph sharp — don't let it blur into a generic sketch.

### Earn every claim
Never assert importance, significance, or legacy without grounding it in concrete evidence. If something is noteworthy, the specific facts will demonstrate that — the reader doesn't need to be told.

### Write flat, not inflated
Default to a neutral, matter-of-fact register. Resist the pull toward promotional, inspirational, or editorial language. Describe what happened; don't editorialize about what it means unless the context explicitly calls for analysis.

### Vary sentence mechanics naturally
Avoid falling into rhythmic patterns: not everything needs a tricolon, a participial phrase tacked on the end, or a dramatic em dash pause. Real human prose has irregular rhythm — some sentences short, some long, some structurally unusual.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Vocabulary
Avoid the overused AI vocabulary cluster. These words co-occur in LLM output and are strong tells when multiple appear together. See the full watchlist at: https://github.com/z3bastian/skills/blob/main/no-ai-writing/references/ai-writing-patterns.md

Key offenders: *delve, tapestry, testament, pivotal, crucial, foster, garner, underscore, highlight, showcase, intricate, enduring, landscape* (abstract), *interplay, indelible, nestled, boasts*.

Not a ban — context matters. "Underscore" meaning a literal underline is fine. One occurrence in a long piece may be fine. A cluster of several is a dead giveaway.

### Puffery and symbolism inflation
Never append claims about broader significance, enduring legacy, or symbolic importance unless directly supported by sources. Especially avoid:
- "stands as a testament to..."
- "plays a vital/significant/crucial/pivotal role..."
- "underscores/highlights its importance/significance"
- "marking a pivotal moment in..."
- "reflects broader [trend]..."
- "symbolizing its ongoing/enduring/lasting impact"

### Superficial participial analyses
Do not attach "-ing" phrase analyses to the ends of sentences — "ensuring...", "highlighting...", "emphasizing...", "reflecting...", "underscoring...", "showcasing...", "contributing to...". These are the narrator claiming what something means rather than reporting what happened. If a fact, event, or inanimate object is the subject of "highlighting" or "underscoring," the sentence is almost certainly hollow.

### The rule of three
LLMs default to groups of three: "adjective, adjective, adjective" or "phrase, phrase, and phrase." Break this pattern. Use two items, or four, or one. Groups of three are fine sometimes — but not as the default rhythm.

### Formulaic structures
- **Negative parallelisms**: "not only ... but also ...", "it's not just about ..., it's ..." — overused and often inappropriate for neutral writing.
- **False ranges**: "from [X] to [Y]" where X and Y are loosely related concepts with no meaningful scale between them.
- **Challenge-then-optimism**: "Despite its [positives], [subject] faces challenges... Despite these challenges, [subject] continues to..." — a rigid formula. If challenges exist, report them without the predictable redemptive arc.
- **Section summaries**: Do not end sections by restating the section's main point. Trust the reader.
- **Conclusion sections**: Do not add "In summary" or "In conclusion" paragraphs that restate what was already said.

### Didactic disclaimers
Never insert "it's important to note/remember/consider" or "it's crucial to differentiate." Present information directly — the reader decides what's important.

### Vague attribution
Avoid weasel wording that implies broad consensus from thin evidence: "has been described as...", "observers have cited...", "industry reports suggest...". Either name the source or drop the claim.

### Elegant variation
Do not swap synonyms for the same concept just to avoid repetition. If writing about a "river," keep calling it a "river" — don't cycle through "waterway," "watercourse," "aquatic artery." Repetition-penalty-driven synonym swapping sounds artificial.

## Formatting Rules

- **No excessive boldface.** Bold is for structural emphasis, not for decorating every key term.
- **No title case in section headings** unless the style guide requires it. Use sentence case by default.
- **No inline-header lists** (bold header followed by colon, then description) unless specifically requested.
- **No emojis** in professional or encyclopedic writing.
- **Em dashes in moderation.** One or two per piece is fine. Five or six in a few paragraphs is a tell. Prefer commas, parentheses, or colons where they work just as well.
- **Straight quotation marks and apostrophes** in plain text contexts.

## Self-Check Before Finalizing

Before delivering any written content, scan for:
1. Did I cluster any AI vocabulary words? Rephrase or remove.
2. Did I assert significance/legacy/importance without concrete support? Cut it.
3. Did I attach a participial "-ing" analysis to the end of a sentence? Rewrite or delete.
4. Did I fall into a rule-of-three rhythm? Vary it.
5. Did I use a "despite challenges... continues to thrive" structure? Break it.
6. Does anything read like a press release, TV commercial, or inspirational speech? Flatten the tone.
7. Did I over-format with bold, lists, or em dashes? Simplify.
